This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem Statement
The application should have two routes.
1. Home page - It will have a search bar and an image list. User should be able to search for images by entering a keyword in the search box and hit enter. From the image list, each image should be clickable. Show 9 images per page. Use pagination.

2. Clicked Image View - Once clicked on an image from the image list, it should open up a popup with a large view of the image and a download button as in the design. The image should get downloaded on Download button click.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1. ### `npm install` 
This will install all the necesary dependency.

2. ### `npm start` 
This will install all the necesary dependency.
